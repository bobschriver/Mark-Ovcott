This program pulls twitter posts marked with certain #tcot (Top Conservatives 
On Twitter) hashtags and adds them to a serialized python map, which serves as
a corpus for a Markov Generator 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#Markov_text_generators. With this 
method, the program can generate text that could feasibly be written
by a conservative on twitter.
